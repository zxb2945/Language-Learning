# The actor's lines of Friends

## 2020.7.30

What's going on with you?

I've got it.

It's not a big deal.

And I saw Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him.

What are you doing later?

If it's of any help.

Most people will drink tea over coffee.

I can't think of anything.

This is all just a little overwhelming.

Not that often.

You mean a backup?

Don't make any rash decisions.

If I were you, I would.

It's not for sure.

It's pretty urgent.

I'm a goal oriented person, eager to learn.

You are hearing one side of the story.

I love having a girl friend, someone I can spoil.

I realized that I had been smoking for 10 years.

To have the determination to do something.

I realized I was too addicted to social media.

How is that possible.

Excuse me, I couldn't help overhearing. 

What if I marry Ross?

Because I cared enough to lie.



It's better than us deciding.

Come on, admit it.

Just in case.

I barely know her.

What's the rush?

We have so much in common./ We have a lot in common.

You look nothing like I would have thought.

What good will my sympathy do them?

You can never have too many of those pumpkin things.

It‘s so fake.

How come we don't hang out here?

That's just me coughing.

So either the dog goes or I go.

What is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?

It just doesn't matter.

It makes sense. / That doesn't make any sense.

That's not gonna work. / That's not gonna happen.

It's up to you.

Because we seem to be having money troubles.

Merely tens of minutes ago...

As you can see.

Have you never been?

Trust me, you can used to it.

You don't seem that mad. / It seem like...

I haven't seen you since...



Doesn't that count?

I'm just wandering that... / I keep wandering about...

This little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.

You're the one who faced your fears and ultimately overcame them.

Why did you get that?   （为什么你会这么想？）

Santa was unavailable.

I hate to say this, but I follow you.

And worst case scenario...

Don't take it to heart.

I got a confession to make.

You must be mistaken.

Is this for real?

On, my god, so do I / So do you.

Not that long.

Year, I bet.

Just drop it. / Don't rush me.

She's not as pretty as she was when she is 29.

Accomplished their goals.

Is everything clear?

 I think I see where you're going.

That's not to say...

It's never my idea.

Now you lost me.

If you let me have him, then I really owe you one.

How long will you be gone?



We have a bathroom emergency.

I wasn't talking to you.

Easy for you to say...

And they're either boring or annoying or...

Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.

There is a lot fun to be had at that new water park.

She doesn't have a strong opinion on it.

If it's any consolation.

Are you new to the area?

Can I give you a hand?

Memorize it.

What would you do if you were in the situation?

Let's look at this objectively.

Yeah, I like that, but just to go in another direction.

I'm just saying,  get his number, just in case.

It brings us into reflections how we define the beauty.

What do you think could've be done before the tragic consequence happened?

I got a lesson.

I am a free speak guy.

We can't do this by Friday.

We have to get her a present.

Believe or not.

What time is Monica supposed to be here?

Stop picturing it. /  Because I just can't picture it.

Have you ever been to one of my weddings?



## 2020.8.19

Even though we are friends...

When I look back over time together.

What do you say we have one?

I just meant hypothetically.

Whati sit?

I wouldn't know about that...

I'm just saying that...

I've been saying that for years.

Make the best use of your own chance.

I couldn't be worse.

This marriage is special for me.

That's what I'm here for.

Where have you been?

What are we gonna do?

Have you seen Chandler?

How much time do you need?

Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today...

There's just something fundamentally wrong?

What did you have challenges?

When is the moment you start to feel scared?

In my case.

I didn't know you used to be that kind guy.

One time when we were dating...

I'm out of control.

I may play the fool at times.



Long time no see.

Haven't seen you in ages.

Just go up and talk to her.

That I hadn't had sex in months.

I have been working out.

...actually have a lot common with magic.

The certain sense of urgency that student feel.

Posing the possibility.

That is not very you at all.

It's very in contrast to her Games of Thrones character.

How did it that go?

How is your trip going?

How did you job interview go?

Do you know what I mean?

No fucking way.

Sorry I kept you waiting so long.

The chemistry is just not right.

I don't think we have necessarily a solution here.

I'm not dining outside.

No wander you're pregnant.

I'd rather have the money.

OK, if you say so.

I have always been deeply passionate about nature.

None of us are. (na no fes are)

Sometimes it makes perfect sense to define things in terms of themselves.

Just for contrast.



Whether or not the actual machine really does what I am about to tell you is completely irrelevant at this moment.

It's approximately(almost) true.

Once we have gotten the operator evaluated to get a procedure.

He should think about this religiously.

It takes a time which is proportional to the argument X.

I'm in a good place.

He is not available.

From another point of view. / Looking from this point of view.

The competition is tight.

You don't necessarily have to...

I can't help wondering...

It's too time consuming.

I've been dying to tell someone.

Why do you want to play this game so badly?

I was going to wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but you're so beautiful, I don't think I can.

From another perspective.

But the real issue is that...

As soon as / Once.

You caught me at a bad time.

I love you in spite of that...

The three vectors specify a rectangle.

Let's make it a little bit concrete.

This is by far the best choice.



## 2020.9.25

Don't kiss ass.

I accidentally packed this with my stuff.

Don't worry we will find you some else.

So look I won't stand in your way if you want to run off with Dom.

As you may know.

You probably know the world inside its literal meaning, but as has been mentioned before Ariana is talking in a very poetic way.

The world authentic describes something that's real and it's opposed to the fake.

No need to panic, deep breath.

Oh my god, honey we are so meant to be together.

Let's say more.

I don't want to have to lie about us being married.

I'm just not that into her, she's not my type.

You don't make a very good first impression.

In my experience, I have found that some of them are quite effective.

I love when you talk dirty to me.

We got a lot of time to kill.

All the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.

I can't say I'm surprised.

The more I worried the more I couldn't sleep.

Follow my lead.

Can you say how much I appreciate you coming with me.

You know I really admire your whole dating attitude.

That would've been better.

I have nothing to be ashamed of.
