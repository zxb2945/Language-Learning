Nowadays, I usually only participate in online communication activities and outdoor hiking activities. I mean on the meetup.

In nature, you can breathe fresh air. In the city, it is not easy for you to feel the change of seasons. But in the mountains, you can feel spring is here.

When I‚Äôm in nature, I don‚Äôt wear a mask because it‚Äôs relatively safe there.

There is a group about combination of hiking and yoga on meetup. You could go hiking somewhere, and then choose a place with a good view to do yoga, such as the seaside, such as the top of a mountain.

Last fall, I went to Showa Memorial Park to do yoga, where there are many beautiful trees with yellow leaves.

Sometimes I organize such hiking activities by myself. Ten to fifteen people. 

Especially during the pandemic,  you need some social activities, otherwise it will not be good for your mental health. I think hiking is the best choice.

Tired from sports activities is not the same as tired from work. So when you feel tired at work, you can choose to do some physical exercises. Believe me,  you will be relaxed. Because the tiredness at work comes more from psychological pressure. Do you understand what I mean?

I have read The Great Gatsby. This is the first English novel I read. At that time I looked up the dictionary while reading, it was an unforgettable reading experience.

Because I rent a room in Tokyo, physical books are not convenient when I move, so kindle is my better choice.

Then after you finish this talk, do you go jogging?

The weather is getting hotter and hotter.

I'm sorry, friends, I have to go to work.

That was beyond my expectation.

When I was a high school student, I read a novel written by Kawabatayasunari,  a Nobel Prize Winner.

This is the first time we meet. / When I first met her...

Actually, I didn't prepare for a concrete topic.

And here it reminds me of the question my friend asked me yesterday. She said how I relieve my stress, I think people tend to become weak when they feel stressful, so maybe it's relevant to today's topic.

Sorry , I don't quite follow you here. / Sorry, I'm not sure (that) I know what you mean. / I'm sorry. You lost me there.

Usually, I don't consciously think about a specific  thing. It depends on what I see or who I'm with.

Sorry, I didn't hear where you came from.

Because It's boring to stay at home,  learning English makes me feel like I'm not wasting my time. And on the other hand, compared with reading and writing, I am not good at speaking English. So, thanks for having me here.

I'm the type who don't like stay one place all the time, I think curiosity to the world is very important to a person. Otherwise, you're easy to feel the emptiness of life. That' terrible. And at that time, there just a job vacancy for me in Tokyo. So it's an easy choice.
