Nowadays, I usually only participate in online communication activities and outdoor hiking activities. I mean on the meetup.

In nature, you can breathe fresh air. In the city, it is not easy for you to feel the change of seasons. But in the mountains, you can feel spring is here.

When I‚Äôm in nature, I don‚Äôt wear a mask because it‚Äôs relatively safe there.

There is a group about combination of hiking and yoga on meetup. You could go hiking somewhere, and then choose a place with a good view to do yoga, such as the seaside, such as the top of a mountain.

Last fall, I went to Showa Memorial Park to do yoga, where there are many beautiful trees with yellow leaves.

Sometimes I organize such hiking activities by myself. Ten to fifteen people. 

Especially during the pandemic,  you need some social activities, otherwise it will not be good for your mental health. I think hiking is the best choice.

Tired from sports activities is not the same as tired from work. So when you feel tired at work, you can choose to do some physical exercises. Believe me,  you will be relaxed. Because the tiredness at work comes more from psychological pressure. Do you understand what I mean?

I have read The Great Gatsby. This is the first English novel I read. At that time I looked up the dictionary while reading, it was an unforgettable reading experience.

Because I rent a room in Tokyo, physical books are not convenient when I move, so kindle is my better choice.

Then after you finish this talk, do you go jogging?

The weather is getting hotter and hotter.

I'm sorry, friends, I have to go to work.

That was beyond my expectation.

Nowadays, the young generation mostly eat dumplings, maybe back in my parents' day,  as you said , the northerners mainly eat dumpling, the southerners eat other food.  but it's indeed, when I have dinner with my friends from north, we would discuss the dumplings thing, The difference between north and south.

Actually, I didn't prepare for a concrete topic.

And here it reminds me of the question my friend asked me yesterday. She said how I relieve my stress, I think people tend to become weak when they feel stressful, so maybe it's relevant to today's topic.

Sorry , I don't quite follow you here. / Sorry, I'm not sure (that) I know what you mean. / I'm sorry. You lost me there.

Usually, I don't consciously think about a specific  thing. It depends on what I see or who I'm with.

## 13 Job Interview Questions 20210612

In my previous job,  we often have new members to join our team.  There is usually such a problem that we   can't take advantage of the power of the team. I mean at first old members would rather do all the work by their own rather than distribute to new members. Because they found it's more efficient. And this lead a problem that new members feel they are unneeded. They come soon and leave soon.

So I realize sometimes although maybe you could totally do a subject by you own efficiently,  you still distribute your work assignment to your co-workers especially new members. Sometimes  cooperation is more important than efficiency.  

I mean eventually you need team, not team need you.

I like a wide range of movie types. Especially French love movies. Like Erick Rohmer, his movies always happen in the 1980s. It's not always romantic, but it's common and realistic.

If you want to date a girl, it's a good choice to watch horror movie in the cinema. Because usually in the cinema, it's dark and the movie on the screen is scary. The atmosphere is perfect for intimacy touch. You won't look awkward.  Of course it's based on the girl like you as well.

 About watching movie in the cinema, there was an interesting thing happened in my days at university. I went watching a famous movie directed by Li'An , one of my favorite movie directors. When I finished it and went out of cinema, I met a young teacher who I knew by chance. She asked me what I doing. I just said watch a movie. She looked surprised and asked me further you just watched movie in the cinema alone? At that time , I started to realize it's a little wired to watch movie in the cinema by yourself.
